RLSolitaireBot is a simple AI bot created to play Solitaire, developed during my vacation to explore real-time screen capture, computer vision, and basic AI techniques. The bot follows a greedy, rule-based strategy to play, winning about once every 10 games â€” better than my personal performance! While the bot doesn't utilize machine learning (ML) as originally planned, it provides a great introduction to these concepts.

## Features

- **Greedy AI Logic**: The bot follows a straightforward strategy, focusing on immediate gains with no long-term planning.
- **Single Draw**: The bot can only play with single draw Solitaire mode.
- **Gameplay Performance**: The bot wins approximately once in every 10 games, which is better than my own Solitaire skills.

- **Windows 7 version of Solitaire**: You can download this from a reliable source.
